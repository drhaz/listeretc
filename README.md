# etc
This is a generalized Exposure Time Calculator for imaging and spectroscopic instruments for the optical-NIR regime (thermal emission is not included). It also contains a growing collection of "optical components" data in `etc/data/comp` for:
* atmospheric transmission
* mirror reflectivities (protected and enhanced Aluminium, gold and silver coatings)
* CCD, CMOS, NIR detector QE curves (23 so far)
* various optical glasses (BK7, CaF2, FK5, fused silica etc)
* sky background/atmospheric emission data
* filter transmissions for LCO and selected ones from ESO, ING, Gemini, SOAR
